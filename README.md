## Lambda expressions

Write more *functional and optimized* codes

Simplest way to *implement interfaces* that has only one abstract method (Functional Interface or SAM - Single Abstract Method Interface _Java8+_)

Browse, filter and extract data from collections in a simpler and more direct way.

Operator lambda *->*


## Basic sintax

No arguments: ( ) -> System.out.println("Hello World");

With argument:  ( s ) -> System.out.println(s);

Two arguments:  ( x, y ) -> x + y;

Two Explicit arguments: (Integer)


## Method references

In some cases it can be used as a replacement for Lambda expressions
Operator Method References 'Class/Obj' :: 'Referenced Method'

 - It can reference an instance method of a particular object
 - A static method
 - An instance method of an arbitrary object from a specific type
